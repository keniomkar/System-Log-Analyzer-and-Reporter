# System-Log-Analyzer-Reporter
System Log Analyser and Reporter â€“ Built with Bash and Python to automate log monitoring. Extracts ERROR/WARNING entries, summarises occurrences, and generates reports. Demonstrates scripting, automation, and cross-platform development skills.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
System-Log-Analyzer/
â”‚â”€â”€ system_logs.txt # Sample system log file (input)
â”‚â”€â”€ log_collector.sh # Bash script to filter logs
â”‚â”€â”€ log_report.py # Python script to generate summary
â”‚â”€â”€ run_analysis.sh # Automation script (runs both steps)
â”‚â”€â”€ filtered_logs.txt # Filtered log output (generated)
â”‚â”€â”€ log_report.txt # Summary report (generated)

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. **Log Collection (Bash)**  
   - `log_collector.sh` scans `system_logs.txt`  
   - Filters out lines containing `ERROR` or `WARNING`  
   - Saves results in `filtered_logs.txt`

2. **Log Reporting (Python)**  
   - `log_report.py` reads the filtered logs  
   - Counts occurrences of each error/warning  
   - Creates a summary report in `log_report.txt`

3. **Automation**  
   - `run_analysis.sh` runs both steps with one command
